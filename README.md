Hello, there!

My name is Carey and I'm happy to share my most featured projects with you!

My personal website (which is also a kind a CV) located at https://jedi2light.moe

My most featured projects at the moment:
 - [ChiakiLisp](https://github.com/jedi2light/ChiakiLisp.git) - yet another LISP interpreter written in pure Python 3 language

I'm currently open for new proposals, I'll be glad to be a valuable part of your project team! Check out my skills and experience on the website above!
